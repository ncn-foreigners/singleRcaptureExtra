# singleRcaptureExtra

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An expention of `singleRcapture` package to handle fitted object from other R 
packages with zero truncated regression capabilities (and in the future the same
for ratio regression models)

### Quick demo

Utilising additive models when effect is non linear:

```{r VGAM}
library(VGAM)
library(singleRcaptureExtra)
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(n = 1000)
y <- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = exp(-1 + cos(x)))
data <- data.frame(y = y, x = x)
data <- data[data$y > 0, ]

additiveModel <- vgam(y ~ s(x, df = 3), data = data, family = pospoisson())

summary(estimatePopsize(additiveModel))
```

We see that `1000` is well with confidence intervals and that estimates for `x` are approximately correct:

```{r plotVGAM}
plotvgam(additiveModel, data)
```
with the actual curve being:
```{r curve}
curve(cos, from = min(x), to = max(x))
```

We also allow bootstrap methods:
```{r VGAMboot}
x <- rnorm(n = 1000)
y <- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = exp(-1 + x))
m1 <- vglm(y ~ x, data = data, family = pospoisson())
summary(estimatePopsize(m1, popVar = "bootstrap"))
```

Utilising popular `countreg` package:
```{r countreg}
library(countreg)
model <- zerotrunc(
  formula = capture ~ gender + age + nation, 
  data = netherlandsimmigrant, 
  dist = "poisson"
)
summary(estimatePopsize(model))
```

compare with `singleRcapture:`
```{r singleRcapture}
model <- estimatePopsize(
  formula = capture ~ gender + age + nation, 
  data = netherlandsimmigrant, 
  model = singleRcapture::ztpoisson
)
summary(model)
```
